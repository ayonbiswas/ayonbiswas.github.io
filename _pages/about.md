I am a second-year ECE masters student at UCSD. I am interested in generative models, reinforcement learing and application of ML to real-world problems. Currently, I am working under [Prof. Michael Yip](https://yip.eng.ucsd.edu/) in a project aimed at unsupervised skill learning in RL.

My coursework involved working in various domains of ML including computer vision, natural language processing and reinforcement learning. I have experienced working with various flavours of feed-forward, recurrent and generative networks. In all my ML projects, I have extensively used Pytorch or Tensorflow in Python. I am also fluent in C, C++ and Matlab.

I received my Bachelor's in Electrical Engineering from IIT Gandhinagar, India, where I worked with [Prof. Anand Sengupta](http://www.iitgn.ac.in/faculty/phy/fac-anand) on denoising Gravitational-wave signals. I have spent a summer at Caltech working under the guidance of [Dr. Ashish Mahabal](https://sites.astro.caltech.edu/~aam/) and [Prof. Jessica McIver](https://gravitational-waves.phas.ubc.ca/group/), where I worked on tracking lockloss events which lead to loss of optical resonance in LIGO interferometer using supervised learning techniques.
